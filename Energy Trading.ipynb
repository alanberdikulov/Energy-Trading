    "# ERCOT futures and CRR arbitrage guide\n",
    "\n",
    "- CRRs: Cash-settled instruments that pay based on the price difference between two locations. They settle off day-ahead congestion.\n",
    "- To compare CRRs with futures, build a synthetic CRR from futures: take the futures price at the sink node minus the futures price at the source node:  \n",
    "  `synthetic value = sink futures price – source futures price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial scan and profiling  \n",
    "   Check row counts, identify columns that are mostly zeros, and see which nodes and time-of-use buckets (on-peak vs off-peak) appear frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Column pruning  \n",
    "   Keep only the columns needed from each file to save memory and make the dataset easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Futures preprocessing  \n",
    "   - Filter to monthly peak and off-peak products.  \n",
    "   - Extract node names and TOU buckets.  \n",
    "   - Normalize date formats.  \n",
    "   - For each `(node, month, on/off)` combination, keep the latest futures settlement right before delivery (or the last available mark).  \n",
    "   This leaves a single synthetic price per `(node, month, TOU)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CRR preprocessing  \n",
    "   - Convert CRR start dates to a canonical month (e.g., first of month).  \n",
    "   - Map time-of-use tags (PeakWD, PeakWE, Off-peak) into simple on/off buckets.  \n",
    "   - Keep only CRR paths whose source and sink nodes exist in the futures dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Join CRRs with futures  \n",
    "   - For each CRR source–sink pair, month, and TOU, match to the corresponding futures prices.  \n",
    "   - Compute the synthetic spread from futures and compare it to the CRR auction result:  \n",
    "     `diff = CRR price – synthetic value`.  \n",
    "   - Compute the number of days between the last futures mark used and the CRR delivery start date (a “gap days” or “break days” measure).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Path-level aggregation  \n",
    "   - Group by path (source, sink, TOU) and summarize: number of trades, mean and standard deviation of `diff`, total MW, average MW, bidder stats, and similar.  \n",
    "   - Save both the trade-level merged dataset and the path-level summary table.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Filter for potentially interesting routes  \n",
    "   - Focus on routes with more than 50 trades.  \n",
    "   - Require an average absolute gap of at least $2/MWh.  \n",
    "   - Identify which CRRs look cheap (negative average diff) or rich (positive average diff) relative to the synthetic futures spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Check persistence over time  \n",
    "   - Break results down by contract month to see if the sign and size of the gaps repeat or fade.  \n",
    "   - Compare monthly patterns so one-off outliers do not drive the entire signal.  \n",
    "   - Track how `diff` evolves over time to see whether there is a stable pattern or just noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Liquidity and tradeability filters  \n",
    "   - Look at open interest and volume on the futures side: are these contracts actually traded.  \n",
    "   - Add CRR metrics like total MW and bidder count to see whether auctions are competitive and scalable.  \n",
    "   - Optionally filter out futures with very low activity or stale prices.  \n",
    "   - Rank opportunities by a mix of price discrepancy (size and t-stat) and ease of execution, then discuss which look promising and what further checks (backtests, risk scenarios, constraints) are needed before any live strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node: A location on the power network (often a substation or zone) where prices are measured.\n",
    "- On-peak vs off-peak:  \n",
    "  - On-peak: higher-demand weekday daytime hours.  \n",
    "  - Off-peak: nights, weekends, and lower-demand periods.\n",
    "- CRR (Congestion Revenue Right): A financial right tied to the price difference between two nodes; it gains value when congestion moves in your favor and loses value when it does not.\n",
    "- Synthetic CRR: The spread between two nodal futures prices. It approximates the congestion value implied by the futures market instead of the CRR auction.\n",
    "- CRR vs synthetic difference:  \n",
    "  - `diff = CRR price – synthetic price`.  \n",
    "  - If `diff < 0`: CRR is cheap vs futures (candidate: long CRR, short synthetic).  \n",
    "  - If `diff > 0`: CRR is rich vs futures (candidate: short CRR, long synthetic).\n",
    "- Open interest: Number of outstanding futures contracts that have not been closed. Higher open interest usually implies better liquidity and easier execution.\n",
    "- MW / total MW / avg_mw:  \n",
    "  - MW indicates the size of a CRR position.  \n",
    "  - Higher total MW and higher `avg_mw` suggest more volume and more meaningful trading activity on that path.\n",
    "- Bidder count: How many distinct participants bid on a given CRR path. A larger bidder count usually means more competition and a more informative auction price.\n",
    "- Break days / gap days: The number of days between the futures price observation used and the CRR delivery start date. Larger gaps mean the futures mark may be stale or already reflecting realized outcomes rather than pre-delivery expectations.\n"

    "## Data engineering challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the two raw data streams and shaping them into something you can actually compare required a few non-trivial steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The nodal futures file holds around 6 million daily records, but most liquidity fields are just zero. So we dropped the useless pieces and kept only prices and open interest. Then we collapsed the daily history down to a single end-of-history value for each combination of node, month, and power type (ON or OFF).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Futures  node labels into strings such as `ERC2T.HB_NORTH_month_on_rtp`, while CRRs store `Source`, `Sink`, and `TimeOfUse` in separate fields. To match both on a common `(node, contract_month, TOU)` tag, we had to do some pattern extraction on the futures side and normalize date and time-of-use formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only about 35k of the 1.94 million CRR auction rows actually map to nodes that have live futures contracts. The rest were dropped so we are not mixing CRRs that cannot be paired with a synthetic futures spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Futures settlements often occur a few days, or even weeks, after the CRR auction closes. Tracking `gap_max_days` helped flag situations where the futures mark might be stale or already reflecting realized congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the futures data shrinks to 2,874 synthetic points and the CRR set narrows to just the nodes that line up with futures records. At each step, only usable matches are kept, so what remains is a cleaner, better-aligned slice of both markets rather than the full, noisy tapes.\n"

    "## Data Exploration\n",
    "Before running the arbitrage pipeline, inspect the raw futures and CRR files to understand liquidity coverage (zero vs non-zero columns), node participation, and MW distributions. This stage surfaces practical constraints (e.g., missing volume data, skewed TimeOfUse counts) so every downstream filter or assumption is backed by evidence from the raw feeds. For example, we confirmed that nearly all `EFRP Volume` entries are zero (so we drop that column later) and that PeakWD + PeakWE volumes justify merging them into a single \"ON\" bucket to match the futures vendor’s naming. Also I aggregated all CRR csv's into one, same done for futures\n"

    "I filter to `_month_on/off_rtp` contracts, extract node and time-of-use labels, convert dates to proper datetime, and keep the latest settlement per `(node, contract_month, TOU)` so each synthetic leg has a single price. I use the `_month_on/off_rtp` family because CRRs are monthly instruments that settle on day-ahead congestion; using weekly or purely day-ahead futures would misalign the tenor and create artificial arbitrage. This step also creates the canonical join keys (node symbol, delivery month, ON/OFF bucket) that every later merge relies on, so I normalize those values here. Open-interest screens can be applied later if needed. And if you are wondering why the dataset suddenly drops to fewer than 10,000 rows, do not ask me either.

The CRR files contain thousands of plant-level nodes that have no listed futures; filtering them out keeps the coverage honest (only about 35k CRRs remain). This step also converts `StartDate` into a true delivery-month timestamp, which lets me align CRRs with the correct futures expiry and later compute timing gaps between when futures last traded and when the CRR strip begins.\n"

Timing between futures marks and CRR delivery is tight, which suggests CRRs often clear richer than synthetic short setups. This looks like a repeatable pattern, though size is still modest.\n",

    "- `HB_WEST` to `HB_HOUSTON` (OFF): `avg_diff` around +3.9 over 78 deals, totalling 198 MW with 21 bidders. Liquidity is decent and the spread is stable enough to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HB_PAN` to `LZ_NORTH` (ON): `avg_diff` around −3.5, from 72 trades totalling 212 MW involving 13 bidders. This looks like a plausible “long CRR, short synthetic” path if risk checks pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HB_NORTH` to `HB_WEST` (OFF): `avg_diff` around +3.3, with very heavy activity – 570 trades, 23,912 MW, 35 participants. This is one of the clearest examples where CRRs tend to clear rich relative to the futures-implied spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HB_WEST` to `LZ_NORTH` (OFF): `avg_diff` around +3.2, 52 trades totalling 300 MW with 12 bidders. Not huge, but still liquid enough to trade around the discrepancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `avg_diff` is positive, CRRs tend to clear higher than the synthetic futures spread, so selling CRRs and buying the synthetic futures position may be attractive. When the spread is negative, CRRs look cheap relative to futures, which can help reduce hedging cost by going long CRRs and short synthetic futures. Whether these ideas are usable in practice depends on path-level volume, bidder depth, and timing. Routes such as `LZ_SOUTH` → `HB_SOUTH` and `HB_NORTH` → `HB_WEST` combine meaningful gaps with strong activity, while some `WAKEWE_ALL` paths show large price signals but limited throughput for scaling.\n"

    "\n",
    "To move beyond just spotting big spreads, I convert each path into a simple trade signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Direction:  \n",
    "   If `avg_diff > 0`, CRRs cleared richer than the synthetic futures spread, so I treat that as “short the CRR / long the synthetic hedge.”  \n",
    "   If `avg_diff < 0`, I flip the trade (buy CRR, sell synthetic).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Signal statistics:  \n",
    "   I use `avg_diff` as the mean and `std_diff` as the volatility, and compute a t-statistic (mean divided by standard error) to measure statistical strength. A higher absolute t-stat suggests a more reliable signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Capacity proxy:  \n",
    "   I multiply `total_mw` by `bidder_count` so I can favor paths that combine depth and competitive participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below filters to liquid paths (at least 50 trades and |avg_diff| of at least 2 $/MWh), adds these metrics, and ranks the most actionable opportunities.\n"
